# GoLang-Algorithms
A collection of GoLang algorithms (sorting, matrices, graphing) that may be useful and/or optimized in the future. This is both for my own use (in case I need to use any of these algorithms in the future) and for anyone else interested in trying their hand at creating algorithms in GoLang, it's a fairly solid base of stuff that can be replicated and likely optimized.
